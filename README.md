# Images Gallery:

Welcome to the Image Gallery project! This is a simple and responsive image gallery that showcases a collection of images with interactive hover effects. The gallery is built using HTML and CSS, and it demonstrates how to create an elegant and user-friendly visual presentation of images.

Features:

- Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes and devices.
- Hover Effects: Images scale up and captions appear with smooth transitions on hover.
- Grayscale to Color Transition: Images are initially displayed in grayscale and transition to full color on hover.
- Shadow and Overlay: Cards and captions feature shadows and overlays for a modern look.


How It Works:

HTML Structure: The index.html file contains the basic structure of the gallery with image cards wrapped in figure elements.


CSS Styling: The style.css file applies styles to the gallery, including layout, hover effects, and transitions.
